Hub List - Mobile 
============
Welcome to the GitHub repo for Hub List mobile edition! [Hub List](http://hublistapp.com) is an open source GTD style productivity application written in JavaScript. 

### Technologies
The mobile edition of Hub List is built with [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) and themed to look like a native IOS application. The desktop edition uses [Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/js/) themed to look like a native Mac OSX application.

### Platforms
The current code base is targeting iPhone and will run as a native IOS application or mobile web app. Once the functionality for the iPhone version becomes stable we can use Sencha Touch's device profiles and theming capabilities to target iPad, Android and potentially Palm and Blackberry pending user interest. If you'd like to work on these platforms sooner [get in touch](http://twitter.com/hublistapp) to coordinate your efforts. 

### Status
The mobile edition is in the early development stages with efforts focused on core functionality and design. The desktop edition is available as an "early beta" app and [downloadable](http:://hublistapp.com) as a native Mac, Windows or Linux app. The desktop version will be re-factored and open sourced when Ext JS 4 is released.
